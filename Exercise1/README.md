## Exercise 1: Problem Statement on Design patterns 
Come up creatively with six different use cases to demonstrate your understanding of the following software design patterns by coding the 
same.
1. Two use cases to demonstrate two behavioural design pattern.
2. Two use cases to demonstrate two creational design pattern. 
3. Two use cases to demonstrate two structural design pattern.

This exercise demonstrates six different use cases of software design patterns using Java, organized into three categories: behavioral, creational, and structural design patterns. Each pattern is implemented with a creative approach, showcasing real-world scenarios and their practical application in software development.

### Behavioral Design Patterns
#### 1. Memento Pattern
#### 2. Observer Pattern

### Creational Design Patterns
#### 1. Builder Pattern
#### 2. Factory Pattern

### Structural Design Patterns
#### 1. Adapter Pattern
#### 2. Decorator Pattern
